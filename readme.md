Osmium Kernel
=============

The goal of this project is to give the general public access to a versatile kernel that is configurable for *any* device, this is to include exceptionally old hardware that only computer enthusiasts own or perhaps even museums in the future. To be more specific though, anything that needs real-mode to run...

It is also my goal to use this kernel in -Project Dynamo-, an opperating system a few friends an I are throwing together for the lot of you. Which also has the goal of appealing to every system, not just new hardware (as good as new hardware is!).

Until this project goes up on the Darklight Dev Team site when we actually get to starting Project Dynamo, I'll try and keep the changelog up to date :P
